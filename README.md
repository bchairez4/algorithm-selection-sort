# algorithm-selection-sort

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the selection sort algorithm using C++. 
The input is an array of items that are of a comparative type and the output is the sorted array.
The way selection sort works is by taking an unsorted list, grabbing the smallest or largest item from it, and inserting it in its sorted place.
This process repeats until the whole list is in sorted order.

Selection sorts are done in-place and iterate up an array leaving behind the sorted array.
