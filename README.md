# algorithm-selection-sort

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the selection sort algorithm. 
The input is a std::vector of elements, that are of a comparative type, acting as an array and the output is the sorted array.

Selection sort is an in-place algorithm that works by taking the input and dividing it into a sorted and an unsorted subarray. The algorithm works iteratively finding the next smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted subarray to swap into the sorted subarray. The process ends when all elements have been sorted.
